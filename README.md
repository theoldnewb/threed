# threed

An attempt of a multi platform C project. Utilizing [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL), [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm) and [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).

We will furthermore use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for shell like functions and other file system operations like creating directories. Otherwise we would need to create several sets of shell scripts for Windows CMD/Powershell or the various Linux shells like sh, csh, bash.

## Getting started

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/theoldnewb/threed.git
